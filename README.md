## Introduction
In the digital age, data has become the new currency — and cyber attacks are the new form of theft. From personal data breaches to nation-state espionage, cyber crimes have evolved in both complexity and frequency. Before any digital forensic investigation can begin, an investigator must first understand *how* these attacks happen. The study of cyber attacks forms the foundation of every successful cyber crime investigation, allowing experts to trace digital footprints, identify attackers, and prevent future incidents.

The **Cyber Security 101 course from TryHackMe** provides a practical entry point into this world. It teaches not only how attacks occur but also how defenders can analyze, mitigate, and learn from them — a mindset that lies at the heart of cyber forensics.

## What Are Cyber Attacks?
A cyber attack is any deliberate attempt to gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt services, or damage digital systems. Cyber attacks target vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or human behavior. They can range from simple phishing emails to highly coordinated ransomware campaigns.

### The Cyber Kill Chain
The **Cyber Security 101** module emphasizes that cyber attacks are not random; they follow a lifecycle known as the *Cyber Kill Chain*:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target  
2. **Weaponization** – Developing or obtaining the exploit  
3. **Delivery** – Sending the malicious payload (e.g., phishing email)  
4. **Exploitation** – Triggering the vulnerability  
5. **Installation** – Gaining persistence in the target system  
6. **Command & Control** – Maintaining remote access  
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Executing the attacker’s final goal (data theft, destruction, etc.)

Understanding this chain is essential for forensic experts because each step leaves behind *digital evidence* — traces that can later be used in investigations.

## Types of Cyber Attacks and Their Digital Footprints

| Attack Type | Description | Forensic Trace |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Phishing** | Deceptive emails or sites trick users into revealing credentials. | Email headers, URL logs, browser cache |
| **Malware** | Malicious software such as viruses, worms, or ransomware. | File hashes, registry changes, system logs |
| **DoS/DDoS** | Flooding systems with requests to disrupt service. | Network traffic logs, repetitive IP patterns |
| **MITM** | Intercepting communications between systems. | Untrusted SSL certs, altered DNS, proxy logs |

Each attack type produces distinct digital artifacts. Forensic investigators use tools like **Wireshark**, **Autopsy**, and **Volatility** to examine these traces and reconstruct the timeline of an incident.

## How Investigators Analyze Cyber Attacks
Cyber forensics is the science of uncovering digital evidence from computers, networks, or cloud systems to identify what happened, how it happened, and who was responsible.

### Key Steps:
1. **Evidence Collection:** Securely acquiring logs, disk images, and volatile data.  
2. **Preservation:** Maintaining the chain of custody.  
3. **Analysis:** Using forensic tools to identify unauthorized activity.  
4. **Reporting:** Documenting findings for legal or internal use.

Through **TryHackMe’s Cyber Security 101**, learners practice basic investigation scenarios — analyzing system behavior, identifying attack indicators, and exploring how network packets reveal suspicious communication.

## Why Understanding Attacks is Essential in Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is not just about recovering deleted files; it’s about understanding *why* those files were targeted and *how* they were compromised.

- **Attack Pattern Recognition** – Detect familiar behaviors in logs.  
- **Root Cause Analysis** – Understand how breaches occur.  
- **Incident Response** – Preserve and act on digital evidence quickly.  
- **Legal Attribution** – Present technical findings in legal proceedings.

In short, **knowing the attack is the first step toward solving the crime**.

## Insights Gained from the TryHackMe Course
The **Cyber Security 101** course reinforced that cybersecurity and digital forensics are deeply connected. Key takeaways include:
- **Attack Surface Awareness**
- **Hands-On Learning** with virtual labs  
- **Tool Familiarity:** Nmap, Wireshark, Linux basics  
- **Ethical Mindset** for responsible disclosure and digital integrity

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite advanced training platforms, cyber forensics faces several challenges:
- **Encryption and Privacy** make evidence recovery harder.  
- **Cloud and IoT** complicate isolation of data.  
- **Evolving Threats** demand constant investigator upskilling.  

Future forensics will increasingly rely on **AI**, **machine learning**, and **automated log analysis** to manage large-scale investigations.

## Conclusion
Understanding cyber attacks is not merely an academic exercise — it’s the foundation upon which digital forensics is built. Without knowing how cyber criminals operate, investigators cannot trace their steps or secure systems effectively.  

Courses like **TryHackMe’s Cyber Security 101** bridge this gap between theory and practice, empowering learners to think like investigators. For future cybersecurity professionals, mastering the anatomy of cyber attacks is truly the first step toward defending the digital world.
